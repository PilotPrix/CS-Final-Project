## Inspiration
**Chinese is hard:**

First of all, I'm trying to improve my Chinese. Second of all, I love listening to C-pop. The main problem is that Spotify's lyrics isn't highlightable, so it can't be copied. Since Chinese texts also cannot be pronounced, there's no way to search up a word you don't know. This is what drove me to create Lingolet. In my experience, nobody, including myself, enjoys Chinese school. Our favourite part of it is the moment it ends. Instead of reading boring texts all day, you can now learn Chinese by having fun, playing Minecraft, becoming more cultured by singing songs, and reading interesting articles. 


**Languages are fun:**
- There is something magical to language learning. As an enthusiast once said, "Learning languages is like living multiple lives." Something that was once jibberish now you
can understand and see another world
- Classes are boring: nobody likes classes
- Extrinsic: motivation for language classes

- Second generation people losing their language and culture, partly due to boring classes
- What if their are different ways?
- What if you could learn languages through watching TV shows and playing Minecraft, singing songs?
- Mission: Making language learning and enchanting experience
